In October, Mayor Gray <a href="http://open.dc.gov">announced a new "Transparency and Open Government Initiative"</a> and opened a period for public comment on how to increase openness and transparency in government. For DC dogooders, this represents the beginning of a fresh opportunity to leverage information generated or captured by the city to advocate for local causes, improve government services, and work alongside government to solve social problems. 
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to do this is to respond to the request for comments on the online form released by the Transparency and Open Government Initiative. However, I also recommend copying and reaching out to Traci Hughes, the District's Director of the Office of Open Government. Charged by the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA) "to bring greater transparency to District government operations", Ms. Hughes ensure's the City's compliance with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the District's Open Meetings Act. Read - if you have a FOIA request, Ms. Hughes can help you navigate the process, as well as help the agency respond. Exciting!

You know who's really excited? Code for DC. So excited, that they organized a working session to think through and draft a response to the request for comment. Over thirty civic hackers showed up on a Wednesday night, including techies, policy wonks, and average folks. The group developed recommendations around data and formats, policy and participation, efficacy measures, and impediments. The work session kicked off with encouraging words from Ms. Hughes, framing her vision for an open, collaborative and innovative approach to the city's transparency initiative.

This initiative has the potential to benefit DC advocates focused on transport, dc budget, dc code, blighted properties, potholes, bike lanes, affordable housing, education, you name it.
Are you inspired to comment and know exactly what you'd recommend and need? Go for it! 
Under the section “What government information should be more readily available online or more easily searched?,” if you're asking for specific data, it's helpful to make the ask in way that states the problem you're trying to solve and the data you need to solve it.

<p> 
A wonky education example to support current issues is: 
<blockquote>I want to participate in the Deputy Mayor of Education's student assignment and school boundary review. In order to make recommendations, I want to understand the student population and mobility among the DCPS and charter schools in my neighborhood. I need the following data for 2009 through 2013, in a CSV format (and API, if possible):
	<ul>
		<li>
		Neighborhood residency info for students at school level (for ES, MS, HS), sorted by Ward
		</li>
		<li>
		Charter and DCPS at school level, with percentage in-bounds, percentage in Ward, sorted by Ward
		</li>
		<li>
		4th and 5th grade attrition rates at every DCPS elementary school, by Ward
		</li>
		<li>
		...
		</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
If you can't think of data you need right now, but want to respond, might I suggest that you take the above example and paste it into your response (ASAP)? Thousands of DC parents will thank you -- starting with me!
