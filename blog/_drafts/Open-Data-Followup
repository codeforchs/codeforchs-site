<p>When the Code for DC projects <a href = "http://codefordc.org/blog/2014/02/20/code-for-dc-goes-to-open-data-day.html">went to Open Data Day</a>, the teams got a chance to share ideas, learn new tools, and, in the case of the Education project, put together an interactive visualization to help parents navigate their school choices.</p>

<p>The <a href = "http://cmgiven.github.io/feeder-patterns/">new website</a> lets parents see which middle schools feed into a particular high school, or which high schools kids from your middle school end up at.  Tracking the movement of cohorts lets parents make more informed decisions about the culture of the schools they're picking (not to mention they can better guess the chance of coordinating on a neighborhood carpool).</p>

<p>Sandra Moscoso, one of the parents who helped get the education project up and running, explains the limitations of the current data, <a href = "http://middlechildindc.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/how-can-data-fix-the-dc-middle-school-problem/">and the potential to expand the project:</a></p>

<p><blockquote>While the data is limited to one year, and cohorts of less than 5 students have been censored for privacy, it’s the first time we have been able to see the informal feeder patterns for every DCPS and charter school. It answers the questions of for each school, where do kids come from and where do they go?

What’s more, because the data is now released (i.e., open data), ANYONE can analyze it for their school, for their neighborhood, or for the entire system. If you are not a data ‘geek’ yourself, but have ideas around how to analyze the data, join the next Code for DC meetup, or grab the closest data geek in your life and get to it.</blockquote></p>

<p>If you'd like to help out the education team, or if there's a data set or just a local question or problem that you'd like to recruit coders and analysts for, come to the next Code for DC meetup on <a href = "http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/159853982/">Wednesday March 19th</a>, to start serving your friends and neighbors.</a>
